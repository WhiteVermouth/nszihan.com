Last year, I created [`Dracula Theme`](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12275-dracula-theme) extension for JetBrains IDEs. The source repo is included in the official [Dracula Organization](https://github.com/dracula/jetbrains). If you want to try it out, all instructions can be found at [here](https://draculatheme.com/jetbrains).

However, except the free community maintained Dracula Theme(s) or UI(s), Zeno Rocha, who created Dracula, also launched the premium version: `Dracula PRO`.

Dracula PRO is featured as:

- A color scheme and UI theme **tailored for programming**
- Made for terminal emulators, **code editors**, and syntax highlighters.
- Designed to be aesthetically pleasing while **keeping you focused**.

A bunch of theme variations are packaged in Dracula PRO, all of these goodies are to make developers more productive.
