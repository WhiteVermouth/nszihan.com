## What is Dracula?

> A dark theme for Atom, Alfred, Emacs, Highlight.js, Hyper, iTerm, JetBrains, Pygments, Slack, Sublime Text, TextMate, Terminal.app, Vim, Xcode, Zsh and many more.

## Preface

Currently there already exists many Dracula theme or UI for many editors or tools. However the JetBrains port only includes Color Scheme, lacking the UI support. Before IDEA version 2019.1, you may use the [Material Theme UI](https://github.com/ChrisRM/material-theme-jetbrains) plugin to make IDEA and other IDEA based IDEs fully Dracula style.

Things changed after IDEA 2019.1 released, JetBrains add official support for Custom UI.

## Dracula Theme Plugin

With the leverage of official Custom UI support, I make a new Dracula Theme for JetBrains IDEs. The theme is released at JetBrains Plugin Repository and open source at GitHub.
